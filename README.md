# Fast and Fourier

Prototype for a fun 2D obstacle course game based on the visualization of Fourier series. Developed using the Godot game engine and tooling.

*Awarded 2nd prize in the BaselHack 2019.*

## Motivation

The Fourier series is a significant mathematical concept with a wide variety of applications. It can be used to approximate any function, even the most complicated arbitrary paths. On top of that, there is a neat way of visualizing its composition.

By using this concept at its core, we seek to create a simple 2D game which is fun to play, pleasing to look at, and might help people develop an intuition, or at least an appreciation for the idea behind Fourier series. 

## How it works

You are presented with an obstacle course. At the beginning you may choose a combination of consecutively attached edges of different sizes and rotational speeds.

The goal is to find a configuration of rotating edges with sizes and speeds (the Fourier series) such that the tracing edge clears the obstacle course (approximates the desired function with sufficient accuracy).
